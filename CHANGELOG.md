## Unreleased
### Fixed
* Manage new workers connections with common offset
* Waiting for workers to finish their jobs bfore closing streams

## 0.6.6 - 2023-04-20
### Added
* New schema_resolver_version config option. Defaults to 1 which means no change for existing users. Users can opt into a version 2 which is much more resilient and will fallback to JSON columns when unable to resolve a particular property. This option is only used when denormalized=True

## 0.6.3 - 2023-03-15
### Added
* Establish message passing pattern from workers to main thread for process introspectability
* Bubble up errors from workers and reraise in main thread with traceback info
* Option to ignore failures in workers via fail_fast config option. This option is set to True and you must explicitly set fail fast to false if you want to process to ignore row insertion errors
### Fixed
* Manage offset in sink class instead of on workers so the stream payload always has the correct offset

## 0.6.2 - 2023-02-20
### Added
* Use changie for changelog management
