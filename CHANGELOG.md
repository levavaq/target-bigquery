## UNREALSED
### Changed
* Remove parallelism for storage_write_api mode

## 0.6.8 - 2023-07-05
### Added
* relax python version to allow 3.11

## 0.6.7 - 2023-07-05
### Added
* added a MAX_JOBS_QUEUED variable to regulate workers's global jobs queue
### Fixed
* fix jobs class attempts variable incrementing
* ensure sinks wait for workers to finish jobs before killing them
* each worker gets its own offset in the storage write implementation since they may process multiple tables

## 0.6.4 - 2023-04-20
### Added
* New schema_resolver_version config option. Defaults to 1 which means no change for existing users. Users can opt into a version 2 which is much more resilient and will fallback to JSON columns when unable to resolve a particular property. This option is only used when denormalized=True

## 0.6.3 - 2023-03-15
### Added
* Establish message passing pattern from workers to main thread for process introspectability
* Bubble up errors from workers and reraise in main thread with traceback info
* Option to ignore failures in workers via fail_fast config option. This option is set to True and you must explicitly set fail fast to false if you want to process to ignore row insertion errors
### Fixed
* Manage offset in sink class instead of on workers so the stream payload always has the correct offset

## 0.6.2 - 2023-02-20
### Added
* Use changie for changelog management
